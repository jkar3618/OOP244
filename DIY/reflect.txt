Through Workshop 3, I learned the concepts of an instance of a class, constructor, and constructor, which are essential functions for encapsulation. 
an instance of a class is that each object or instance in the class occupies a unique memory area. 
Data on the object is stored in a corresponding memory area. 
The constructor is a special member with the same name as the class called when the object is created.  
The destructor is a special member function that calls when an object disappears. 
The name of the extinct person must be preceded by a ~ before the name of the class. 
Moreover, constructor and constructor do not have a return type. 
In addition, I can see the difference between "this" and "*this" through this workshop. 
In summary, "this" is a pointer to the address of the object. 
Used to access member variables within a member function. 
In addition, "*this" refers to the object itself that the "this" pointer points to. 
Used to access the object itself within a member function.
