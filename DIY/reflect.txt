I learned about dynamic memory allocation and dynamic memory release while doing this workshop 2 part 1 and part 2. 
Dynamic memory means allocating memory space to be used while a program is being executed. 
After the program ends, the memory allocated for the operating system to use can be returned, and if requested, it can be reallocated. 
By allocating dynamic memory, you can allocate as much memory as you want depending on the situation and adjust the size even if it is already allocated. 
In addition, dynamic memory allocation must be released when the allocated memory is not in use. 
If dynamic memory allocation is not released, it may cause memory leakage. 
If a memory leak occurs, the pointer to the dynamic memory may be out of range before the program releases the corresponding memory. 
The pointer to dynamic memory changes the value before the application cancels memory allocation, 
starting with the address stored in that pointer.
