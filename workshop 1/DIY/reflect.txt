Through this workshop Lab, I subdivided the program into modules, compiled each module separately, 
and organized the executable in each compilation result. 
I compiled a modular program by implementing source code by segmenting 
the w1p1.cpp file into header files and implementation files. 

In DIY, part 2, I learned namespace new data types such as and bool and string that were not in c and the features of c++ such as cout and cin. 
I had a hard time positioning the pointers in the file while doing DIY, but I was able to solve the problem when I learned new features like fseek and SEEK_SET. 
In addition, the parameter of function toLowerCaseAndCopy, which has the ability to change uppercase to lowercase, 
was initially confused about what value to send, but gradually realized through walk-through and debugging.
